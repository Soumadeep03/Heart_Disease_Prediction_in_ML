# Heart_Disease_Prediction_in_ML
Using Machine Learning Algorithms predicts whether a patient has a heart disease or not. 

It uses various Classification models which are trained on the basis of previous datasets.

These model scores are put in voting to give the best score prediction.

For training the model UCI Dataset- Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset is used.
